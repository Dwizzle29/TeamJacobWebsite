      <p>Team Jacob wins again! It was a tight game this week, but of course it was a full moon and the power was on their side. This week they versed the Mighty Warriors, who have a 88% win rate at the moment.
Set 1
This set the team came in with utter sheer determination with Kate hitting two massive spikes that almost blew the Warriors away. Then in comes Eric and Sean with their powerful blocks that no spikes can even pass through.  Set one finished up with a win for Team Jacob 25-15!

Set 2
One might say that the Jacobs came in off a high after the last set, but sometimes the ball can drop… and in this case it did. A lot. Maybe a bit too giddy, and loss of concentration or thinking they had it in the bag because of the full moon. Unfortunately, this set was not a win, with two time outs called by Coach Grace there was slight come back but the Jacobs only got through with 12-25.

Set 3
Coach Grace and assistant coach Sarah gave the team a talking to throughout the break, with a new line up and no hesitation the team was able to get up by 10 sets before the Warriors even had a chance. The power duo Kate and Naish were at it with their team work and setting one another up, and Charlize produced amazing consistency with her serves earing 15 points and no serves lost. Warriors were almost running off at this point with a set win again to Team Jacob 25-10.

Set 4
Could it be the end, did the full moon work in the favour of the Jacobs or was Edward(warriors) going to come in and defeat them. Not a chance. Brandon and Gabe the two newbies on the team, who are a real dynamic duo, proved themselves in this set, sparkling one might say. Jack came in ending on the floor diving for far too many balls and ripped his pants.. It was almost like the team hadn’t already been playing for 40 minutes, they were on fire causing them to win 25-15, taking the big win for this game.

Overall the team learnt a couple of lessons, never trust the full moon and the power it gives, and two always listen to Coach Grace and Sarah.

Until next week. WHAT TEAM?
